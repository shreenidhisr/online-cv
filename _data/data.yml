      - role: Software Engineer - 1
        time: 2022 July - Present
        company: Cloudera, Bangalore
        details: |
          In my role as a Software Engineer I, I encountered a series of challenging tasks that encompassed a wide range of responsibilities, 
          from writing code to addressing S1 escalations. My primary focus was on the DR stories of Hive ACID replication, 
          where I played a pivotal role in enhancing the platform's functionality and performance.
            - Designed and implemented a critical feature called "Reset," 
              which effectively reset the replication flow from a failover state to a normal state, ensuring data consistency and reliability.
            - Gained comprehensive insight into the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), providing me with a holistic understanding of software engineering practices.
            - Gained insights into the open-source community by contributing to the Apache Hive project, further honing my development skills.
            - I expanded my expertise to orchestrate Apache Iceberg replication through Cloudera Manager. In this role, I implemented Kerberos security support, 
              enhanced replication for each table by providing mechanism to replicate column statistics, and provided log4j support for Iceberg replication.
      - role: Software engineer intern
        time: 2022 jan - 2022 June
        company: Cloudera, Bangalore
        details: |
          During my internship, I had the opportunity to work extensively on the replication component of Cloudera Manager, 
          which plays a pivotal role in orchestrating data replication for specific services. This experience exposed me 
          to various aspects of software development, testing, and open source contributions, making it a valuable addition to my resume.
            - Developed unit test cases to ensure the reliability and robustness of the replication component.
            - Participated in refactoring the existing Hive ACID replication code, enhancing its maintainability and performance.
            - Gained insights into the open-source community by contributing to the Apache Hive project, further honing my development skills.
            - Worked with cutting-edge technologies in the big data ecosystem, including Hive, Hadoop, YARN, HDFS, and more.
